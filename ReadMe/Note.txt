char *a VS const char *a

char pointer: pointer to modifiable character (pointer and pointed charcter can change)
const char pointer: pointer can change, pointed charcter can't change

=========================

What is extern int ?

extern int is keyword to make global variable which is already defined somewhere in projet.
So it can be shared across multiple source files
when we use extern int:
	- It tells compiler this is int variable
	- don't allocate memory for this in current file
	- Assume a is already defined somewhere (i.e: we allocated memory for it in anothe file)
The reason to use is to use same global varible across many files.
